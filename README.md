# Intelligent Robotics - Robot Waiter - Team Stewart
As a demonstration of the capabilities of intelligent robotics, we put together a robotics system capable of emulating the role of a waiter in a restaurant. It uses ROS, custom navigation, task prioritization, object detection, speech recognition, web interface, speech emulation and RFID to carry out the tasks this role would involve. We believe that our implementation of a robot waiter holds up to the standard of a human waiter.
